<p><font face="Arial">During the flights this summer I was prepared to take 
advantage of any condition that might present itself which would allow me to 
grab a leg on the coveted Golden C license. Realizing the distance leg of a 
hundred and ninety-two miles would be more difficult, I had hoped to accomplish 
this leg first; however, after several unsuccessful attempts, I decided that if 
altitude conditions came along I would not pass it up and would do my best to 
get the necessary altitude of ninety-eight hundred above point of release. So, 
on August 16, 1943, with Mr. C. E. Bailey, official glider observer standing by, 
I inadvertently ran into more altitude than I had bargained for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With my son, Jimmie, at the controls of the tow plane, a 
1929 vintage of a Curtiss Fledgling, we were lined up for a west take-off at the 
Municipal Airport. We had considerable delay getting cleared due to traffic. The 
runways were steadily getting hotter and I was on the verge of prostration from 
heat when the Fledgling received the green light (45 minute delay). I am delay 
conscious due to air line flying.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">

<p><font face="Arial">When approximately two-thirds down the runway at about a hundred feet, the 
Minimoa received a terrific boost of lift. On the spur of the moment I started 
to release from the tow plane, then on second thought was afraid the Fledgling 
would drag the four hundred foot tow line through something at the edge of the 
field, so passed up the opportunity. I immediately started a left turn, which 
was the signal for the Fledgling to do the same. In this manner, I can 
practically control the tow plane to any point where in my estimation I might 
find better soaring conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Soon we were back near the airport, headed northeast, and release was made at 
approximately one thousand feet. Being pretty well assured that I had lift at 
the airport, I purposely tried to hold the release altitude down and still reach 
the airport. We were soon there with lift suddenly at about ten feet per second, 
but it must have been a fast traveling bubble for it began to diminish rapidly, 
or maybe I simply could not stay in the region of lift. I did get some two 
thousand feet, but within a few minutes I found myself at seven hundred feet on 
the east end of the airport, struggling to stay aloft. However, I was soon 
rewarded with better than three thousand and, apparently, sustained flight would 
be of no effort due to well developed cumulus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After some time I found myself southwest of the airport under a well 
developed cloud with good lift and, shortly, on instruments at twenty feet a 
second. It looked as if I would be able to get the necessary altitude here, but 
at approximately eleven thousand lift suddenly ceased and I came out on the back 
side, hoping that I might be able to go back in again and get a bit more 
altitude to assure myself that I had plenty for the requirement. It was not so 
easy though, as I was in sort of a semi-instrument condition, losing altitude 
rapidly and could not locate the cloud.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I soon realized that I was on the back side of a well developed thunder 
storm. I could hear thunder and lightning was quite frequent, so I knew the best 
thing for me to do was to set a northeasterly course dive through the thunder 
storm, get on the front side and land back at the airport. I was still losing 
altitude at an alarming rate when I felt the Minnie shake a few times and then 
the fun started, or was it fun? The realization that there was an unknown 
quantity soon put a damper on the fun.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On instruments, of course, and I noticed by the Kollsman climb indicator that 
the Minnie was going up at the rate of 10-20-30-40 feet per second. It started 
to rain in torrents and I thought to myself, if I reach the ice level with this 
much water present, I really am going to get a load of ice and maybe run into 
difficulty. I was still trying to hold an easterly course, but by this time the 
turbulence was so terrific my sense of direction was lost and the compass was 
spinning completely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At fourteen thousand the ice level was reached, which was fifteen thousand 
above sea level, as the airport is one thousand above sea level. As I had 
expected, the Minnie took on a good half-inch of ice and out went the air speed 
and the Minnie became quite nose heavy. I still had the bank and turn and for 
pressure I was using an atomizer bulb and, believe me, I was really pumping. On 
flights in the past I had practiced flying the Minnie without the use of the air 
speed, depending on the noise of the movement of the Minnie through the air, so 
this did not worry me too much until the noise of the hail became so much 
greater than the movement of the Minnie that I was forced to rely on the mushing 
qualities of the Minnie by holding the stick well back and easing off when the 
feel of a stall was approaching.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It seemed impossible to fly straight due to turbulence. There would be 
intervals when the hail would cease and some semblance of a straight flight 
could be accomplished, but all this time I was still going up. Considerable hail 
had beaten through what I thought was an exceptionally tight enclosure. I was 
practically sitting in ice, but I was not cold, whew!! Would I ever get out of 
this condition ….15-16-17-18-19 thousand feet above sea level!! I remember 
noticing that the Kollsman sensitive altimeter would hang at intervals, break 
loose, and jump a complete revolution and hang again. I remember seeing it above 
eighteen thousand, and how much higher we went only the barograph will tell. By 
this time I was getting worried about altitude and its effects and figured that 
I must concentrate completely on getting out of the storm or passing out for 
lack of oxygen. The latter would mean the Minnie would be out of control, a 
dive, excessive speed – breaking up the sailplane, and if I came to in time to 
open the parachute I might still be in the ascending current and would have to 
ride the storm again hanging by the chute harness. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">I was trying to hold the Minnie straight. It seemed like I had been fighting 
this thing for ages – I was getting very tired – the thunder and lightning were 
much too close. At times I thought the Minnie would take it no longer. We would 
hit periods of hail that I thought would hammer in the enclosure. Finally, we 
hit a comparative calm and I got the Minnie turned in an easterly direction, but 
we flew and flew with the compass swinging from north to south. After a 
considerable time the turbulence abated and in a few minutes I thought we were 
in the clear, but could not see out because of the iced over enclosure. After a 
bit I had one of the windows open to assure myself and saw that we were entirely 
in the clear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">By the time we were down to an altitude where the ice began to melt, I must 
have been getting quite groggy. I could see Atlanta plainly but could not find 
the airport. I looked at the altimeter and it registered four thousand feet and 
I thought to myself – how did I get down to four thousand so quickly, it 
certainly looks higher, I must be all wrong, the airport must be on the other 
side of town, so I headed in that direction but I didn’t know how I could make 
it as all lift had disappeared. I had resigned to land away from the airport and 
was down to two thousand when I suddenly saw the airport practically underneath 
me, then did I feel silly. It suddenly occurred to me that the altimeter had 
another revolution to make and I was really at twelve thousand feet. Due to the 
absence of physical strain, I began to get cold but we were soon down to warmer 
levels and from four thousand the Minnie and I indulged in all the acrobatics 
that we knew how to execute.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After landing, the Minnie was given an inspection for damage. The cockpit 
enclosure glass was cracked, the upper side of the elevator fabric was very 
loose and cracked and required replacement due to the enforced upward position, 
balsa fillets for the wing butts were damaged, the balsa nose piece that forms 
the streamline for the fuselage was badly split and the paint was off, and the 
entire upper surface needed a new coat of varnish. I believe the damage would 
have been much greater had it not been for the coating of ice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I believe the barograph will show that we were above sixteen thousand above 
sea level for at least twenty minutes. At one time during the ascent we squarely 
encountered a gust that threw us completely over as in a loop, and at the point 
of recovery the Minnie apparently hit the same gust and the loop repeated. I 
cannot praise the Minnie too highly from a structural standpoint and I believe 
she will take anything in the way of storms if the airspeed can be held down 
below forty-five.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Riding a storm as big as this one, with only a bank and turn and compass to 
rely on is simply foolishness. I found out the next day that crops where the 
storm passed over were damaged by hail, and I knew that when I encountered such 
heavy rain at the start I was in for a dandy ride, but there was nothing I could 
do about it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the future, I hope to have some arrangement for heating the pitot tube for 
the prevention of ice, as well as some arrangement for oxygen. I may never need 
them, but you can never tell.</font></p>
