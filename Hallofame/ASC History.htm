History of the Atlanta Soaring Club</b></i></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
By Mitch Deutsch<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="4">
<b><i>February 1986</i></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Atlanta Soaring Club's inception can be traced to a very tragic day at Peach 
State Gliderport.&nbsp; On February 11, 1986, Peach State's main hangar caught fire 
and destroyed much of Peach State's fine sailplane fleet, including a Grob 103, 
two Grob 102 Club's, a Grob 102 Standard, a Piper Pawnee tow plane as well as 
two other privately owned ships, an AS-W19B and a K-6.
Bob Tisdale, who operated Peach State Gliderport as a commercial operation for 
approximately 10 years prior to the fire, had expended much money and quite a 
bit of effort to provide a modern fleet of sailplanes as well as created a fun 
place to fly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bob decided that a hybrid club/commercial 
operation was the best option to keep soaring alive. The 926th glider squadron, 
a club type group formed earlier to foster camaraderie and enjoyment of the 
sport of soaring, was expanded and all pilots who flew at Peach State were 
encouraged to join the Squadron or pay higher prices for the services.&nbsp;
Folks began to show their support. An impromptu banquet was held at the Holiday 
Inn in Griffin in late April and over fifty pilots attended to show Bob their 
support.</font></p>

<p align="center"><i><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Another Setback</font></b></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Peach State's tow plane, Pawnee N11FU, caught fire in flight on July 27, 1986 
and made an emergency, but safe landing. The magneto apparently exploded and 
caught fire, causing extensive damage to the engine area forward of the 
firewall. Repairs were going to cost several thousand dollars.
Bob Tisdale advised that effective September 30, 1986 that glider operations 
would cease. The February fire, loss of rental equipment and revenue, and 
inability to obtain renewal for the insurance all combined to force Peach 
State's demise.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><i><b>The Atlanta Soaring Club is 
Conceived</b></i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of pilots were not ready to 
give up their love of soaring and began exploring options to keep soaring alive 
at Peach State. After much number crunching by Don Abrams and Mitch Deutsch it 
was determined that a club operation was feasible. In fact, the projections 
allowed for a club to operate with the help of professional staff, with Elsie 
and Derek Johnson continuing on. Late in August, a telephone survey was made to 
a number of pilots to confirm if there would be sufficient support for such a 
club. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A very positive feedback was 
received from these phone calls, and an emergency meeting was held in 
Atlanta on September 4 to discuss the proposed plans with the Atlanta glider 
community. The goal was to have enough interest and funding to start a new 
not-for-profit club, to be called the Atlanta Soaring Club (ASC). It was obvious 
that the local pilots still wanted to soar and were willing to put forth the 
effort to start and grow a new club.
By the end of the month, ASC signed up sixty members, was legally chartered, had 
elected officers, final bylaws and operating rules, signed a land lease with Bob 
Tisdale at Peach State, arranged for a tow service and had sailplanes to fly.
The Directors included Jeff White, Chris Bowick, Gary Bawtinhimer, Ken Sturgill 
(Secretary), Don Abrams (Treasurer), C.B. Howard (Vice President) and Mitch 
Deutsch (President).
Operations were to be headquartered in the &quot;old&quot; bunkhouse just north of the new 
hangar and Peach State's remaining Grob 103 (N429BG) was leased back to the 
club. Gary Bawtinhimer had purchased a G102 (N792G) also for lease back to the 
club. Other ships that were being looked at for acquisition were a 1-26 and a 
Blanik L-13.<br>
<br>
Donations of equipment and time poured in. A partial list of donations included:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff White: Meeting room donation, attorney compensation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don Abrams: Financial planning and analysis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. B. Howard: Securing insurance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mitch Deutsch: Coordination of club formation and membership drive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jay Newell: Meeting room donation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris Bowick, Dee Anderson, Vic and Pam Crane, Marty Pautz, Frank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fincher, Frank Ivey, Tom Speir, Philip Anderson: Clubhouse equipment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; furnishings, telephone canvassing, and moving efforts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derek and Elsie Johnson: Unrelenting help, advise and support to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organize and form the club<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob Tisdale: Cooperation, good spirit during the transition.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><i><b>Atlanta Soaring Club is 
born!</b></i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">October 4 was the first day of operations for the new Club. At 11:06 AM, Jim 
Neffinger (student) and Derek Johnson (instructor) took off on tow in the Grob 
103 behind Bob Tisdale in the Pawnee. That first weekend also saw much activity. 
Bill Kelley, Al Grizzard, and Steve Naylor fought for the first flight in the 
Baby Grob 102, with Steve beating the Grob's owner, Gary Bawtinhimer, to the 
inaugural flight.
Don Abrams, in his AS-W19, scored the club's first land out on the first 
weekend, landing about 25 miles to the west. C.B. Howard found a leased-back 
Blanik, from Tallahassee, and it arrived on October 7.
At the end of October, ASC had 72 members and though things were going well.<br>
<br>
The dates for the SSA National Convention to be held in Atlanta were announced. 
Mitch Deutsch had met with Bob Gaines and Bob Gray (the convention planners) and 
it was agreed that ASC should be an integral part of the convention planning and 
execution, and this event would serve to bring the various soaring groups in 
Atlanta together. The call was put out to ASC's membership to provide ideas and 
be prepared to help.<br>
<br>
Some concern was raised about the potential development of two-acre housing 
tracts at the current peach orchard just south of the runway. Bob Tisdale 
contacted the FAA and made his views known to the Pike County Commission. Since 
the gliderport was a state licensed facility, the FAA has some jurisdiction 
regarding clearances, etc. More homework was required of the seller and the 
commission tabled the rezoning application. Bob Tisdale posted &quot;Low Flying 
Planes&quot; warning signs along the entrance road to alert potential purchasers and 
other visitors of the ongoing air traffic over that area.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jim Culp advised that aero tows were 
available from two airports north of Atlanta; at Rome and Jasper. Pilots needed 
to call ahead for reservations.<br>
<br>
Jay Newell arranged for production members of the TV
show, &quot;Georgia Digest&quot; to visit the Club and receive a few flights. The 
resultant videos would be broadcast on all eight of GPTV's stations
throughout the state.<br>
<br>
<b>MAY 1987</b><br>
Club activity for the early season was quite good. Badge winners included Silver 
legs for Steve Naylor and Bob Sykes with Bob earning the full badge. Steve 
Naylor set a GA state record for his climb to 11,226 MSL<br>
<br>
<br>
The 1-26, N2582H, was officially purchased from Chuck Childers and was 
immediately made available to the members. Due to the increase in the number of 
members and their flying successes, a &quot;Member's Recognition
Board&quot; was constructed. The Board contained Polaroid mug shots of the members 
and listed their accomplishments (badges, ratings, solos, state records, etc.<br>
<br>
Don Abrams, who had the longest out and no return flight, donated a perpetual 
trophy called the &quot;Down and Out Trophy&quot; which will be given to the pilot who 
flies the longest out and no return flight. The only other limitation was that 
the flight had to result in a safe and damage free landing (except for the 
pilot's ego).<br>
<br>
Don Abrams displayed his AS-W19B to the Atlanta Chapter of the Sierra Club. 
Assisting in this effort were Derek Johnson, Charles Pinson, Jay Newell and 
Mitch Deutsch. The presentation was tailored to the Sierra Club's interests and 
a slide show and video of soaring in the Sequatchie Valley was shown as well as 
the short video of ASC activities short by &quot;Georgia Digest.&quot;<br>
<br>
<b>SEPTEMBER 1987</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Figures for the first year of operations included 95 members, 2307 tows pulled, 
1578 hours in club aircraft and 405 hours of dual instruction. Fourteen students 
soloed, seven ratings issued and two state soaring records were recorded.<br>
<br>
An update on the SSA Convention to be held in Atlanta in February 1988 called 
for ASC members to volunteer to assist with the daily operations as well as 
assistance with exhibit set-up/teardown, meeting folks at the airport, speaker 
proctor, etc.<br>
<br>
ASC's Board of Directors offered to sponsor a Boy Scout's Explorer Post. Heading 
up this effort was Chris Bowick, a Scoutmaster himself who out the call out for 
three other volunteers to assist the efforts. The sponsorship should provide ASC 
with potential new members, as the age of the Post's members are between 14 and 
21.<br>
<br>
<b>DECEMBER 1987</b><br>
With the national convention only two months away, Mitch Deutsch, as &quot;Volunteer 
Coordinator&quot; for the convention put the final call out for ASC members to 
assist. It was anticipated that each soaring group would have its own 
&quot;coordinator&quot; to work at a club level to insure each club's resources could be 
efficiently tapped.<br>
<br>
<b>FEBRUARY 1988</b><br>
The Club is scheduled to have a booth on the floor of the convention, where 
videos will be run, questions will be answered and club promotional merchandise 
(mugs, shirts, etc) would be sold.<br>
<br>
Two speakers from ASC were planning to give presentation seminars. Derek Johnson 
would participate in the Instructors Revalidation Clinic preceding the 
convention and later talk about soaring in England. Mitch Deutsch and Jay Newell 
would share their experiences in forming ASC in a presentation entitled &quot;What to 
do when your Gliderport is in sink and your are on final glide.&quot; ASC would also 
display its &quot;new&quot; G102 on the convention floor.<br>
<br>
The convention efforts took much of the Club's efforts for the remainder of the 
month. The Club ably assisted Mid-Georgia Soaring Association in sponsoring 
quite a successful event with over 700 persons in attendance.<br>
<br>
An important event that occurred during the convention was a meeting held 
between Mitch Deutsch and John Karlovich, owner of Etowah Bend Airport just 
northwest of Cartersville, GA which laid the groundwork for the Club's
impending move.</font></p>

<br>
<b>MARCH TO MAY 1988</b><br>
The title story of &quot;The Phoenix,&quot; the newsletter of ASC now edited by Terri 
Tillman proclaimed &quot;Atlanta Soaring club Rises High With Relocation to Etowah 
Bend.&quot; (Mitch had &quot;retired&quot; a eight year stint as newsletter editor to focus on 
the Club's move).&nbsp; The article, written by Mitch Deutsch, summarized for the 
members the issued leading up to the move from Peach State.<br>
<br>
The search for a new home was brought about by several reasons; increasing 
uncertainty of additional (and unworkable) air space restrictions around 
Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, the proposed Mode C requirements, the shift of the 
demographics of potential club members more further north and the impending sale 
of Peach State by Bob Tisdale all cast doubt about the Club's long term security 
at Williamson.<br>
<br>
In December 1987, a couple of members of the search committee, Gary Bawtinhimer 
and Jack Pittard came upon Etowah Bend and met John and Audrey Karlovich.&nbsp; When 
Gary and Jack landed, they thought they were going to just visit another dusty 
strip in rural Georgia. Instead, as the rounded one of the hangars, they saw a 
glider trailer and felt they had found the &quot;promised land.&quot; They walked up the 
hill to the Karlovich residence and met Audrey, who in true southern fashion, 
invited both Jack and Gary inside for refreshments. Coupled with its convenient 
location, three stoplights and twelve miles from I-75 and less than 40 minutes 
from the I-285/I-75 intersection, Etowah Bend seemed like glider nirvana.<br>
<br>
Several meetings later, the basic premise of the agreement was made. John would 
make the necessary capital improvements and ASC would lease the land. The formal 
agreement was signed on March 25, 1988. It should be noted that John was an 
old-time M-GSA member, having been very active in the soaring scene in the 60's 
and 70's. John advised one of the reasons he wanted to have ASC at Etowah Bend 
was he wanted to give back to soaring and help ensure that soaring would 
continue to be viable.<br>
<br>
John had advised he would expedite the construction to meet our situation, but 
we knew the accelerated move was going to be tough. We had no enclosed space to 
work out of, no water, sewer, phone or power.&nbsp; The spring of 1988 was unusually 
wet (and muddy) which would test the resolve of all the club members as well as 
the Club's new landlord.<br>
<br>
Initially, John would&nbsp; construct a covered T hangar to shelter five assembled 
gliders and twelve in trailers. Derek and Elsie's trailer was relocated from 
Peach State and would serve as an interim clubhouse. Towing would be provided by 
John or Jimmy Karlovich via a Piper Pawnee.<br>
<br>
On April 24, John and Jimmy Karlovich, rolled the revamped crop duster out of 
their hangar. Jim then did a test flight confirming the Pawnee was ready. Tom 
Smith and Derek Johnson hooked up the Grob 103 to the tow rope and at 3:15 pm, 
the slack was taken out and the first glider tow left Etowah Bend. 
Unfortunately, a spring failed on the tow plane upon landing and&nbsp; only one 
flight was had for the Club's first day.<br>
<br>
The following members were recognized for their assistance in the move and 
assistance in restarting operations: ASC's Board of Directors&nbsp; (Jay Newell, Don 
Abrams, Charles Pinson and Mitch Deutsch) Derek and Elsie Johnson, Gary 
Bawtinhimer, Jack Pittard, John Callaway, Revel Freeman, Bill McKay, Wells 
Morse, David Campbell, Mark Darlington, Jack Wright, John Callaway, Mike Rossi, 
Fernando Silva, Rick Valley, Steve Naylor, Chris Bowick, Thomas Gurtmann, Mike 
Katopes, Walt Valesky, Noah Pittard, Sam and Sybil Stana, David Finkel, Frank 
Trowbridge, Tom Fluornoy, Tom Smith, Terri Tillman and the Karlovich family 
(Audrey, John and Jimmy)<br>
<br>
<b>JUNE 1988</b><br>
During the first month of operations at Etowah Bend, over 100 tows were taken. 
While not flying, members assisted on the many chores on the ground, including 
moving rocks (and more rocks) and debris, helping the Johnsons settle down in 
their relocated home, transporting and rigging ships, installing the power pole 
for the meter, and in collating and mailing the May 1988 &quot;Phoenix&quot; announcing 
the move which was mailed to over 400&nbsp; pilots in Georgia and Alabama.&nbsp; Jay 
Newell arranged a feature article in &quot;Adventure Magazine&quot; a targeted 
distribution quarterly magazine specializing in outdoor adventure-type 
activities and sports. Charles Pinson displayed his DG-300 at an airshow at 
Peachtree Dekalb airport.<br>
<br>
The M-GSA newsletter also printed some kind comments about ASC in its 
newsletter. &quot;Best wishes to Atlanta Soaring Club, who during the convention 
struck a deal with member John Karlovich to move to his airport. We have seen 
this club make many good moves: forming the club, ensuring its continued 
existence, joining the SSA and participating in the convention, demonstrating 
their commitment to soaring in Georgia- and now, through the generosity of John, 
they have found their new home.&quot;<br>
<br>
New full members included Paul Schmidt, Jack Wright, and Jim Jackson. Ron 
Roberts, Gilly Smith and Harold Buck joined as associate members. Ron was to fly 
his Concept 70, Harold his Nimbus 3 and Gilly his LS6. Mike Rossi purchased 
Richard Bramblett's portion of AS-W19B &quot;6T&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The club proposed construction of a clubhouse, to be built on the west end of 
the newly constructed T hangar. Mitch Deutsch and Rick Valley, architect and 
contractor respectively, brainstormed and came up with a plan to utilize the 
existing hangar's roof structure and just infill the walls and slab. A 
preliminary budget for Phase 1 ($2400)-exterior walls and concrete slab only- 
took advantage of &quot;sweat equity&quot; and donated materials.&nbsp; Phase 2 (interior 
finishing) needed additional donations (cash and material) as well as volunteer 
labor.<br>
<br>
<b>OCTOBER 1988</b><br>
Work on the clubhouse continued with window installation, exterior painting, 
interior wiring and exterior trenching for the underground power. Participating 
in these efforts were Jack Wright, Bill Kelley, Carlos Barrosso (painting and 
caulking); Rick Valley, Tom Smith, Ned States and Mitch Deutsch (interior walls 
and trim); Jorge DeCubas and Revel Freeman (glass installation); Alan Cox and 
Bill Rouse (interior wiring). The clubhouse looked almost finished and all 
stepped back to take a look at their collective accomplishments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>NOVEMBER 1988</b><br>
On the late afternoon of&nbsp; November 5, the inclement weather took a turn for the 
worst. At about 4:00 PM, the wind began howling, and was getting dark and a 
roaring sound emanated from the west. A tornado was about to hit Etowah Bend.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Within thirty seconds, the entire clubhouse and hangar were destroyed. The 
gliders tied down under the hangar were displaced against the parked trailers 
and the club's Grob 102 was flipped inverted on top of the trailers. Some of the 
trailers and their contents were damaged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mitch Deutsch was pinned under the roof debris and was rescued by Al Grizzard, 
Rick Valley and Mike Rossi. Tom Smith had cuts on his head and was taken to the 
hospital in Cartersville. Initially Jay Newell was unaccounted for but was 
located a few minutes later huddled in the Johnson's residence with Derek and 
Elsie.<br>
<br>
Once everybody was accounted for, the dazed members surveyed the damage. Only 
two walls of the clubhouse remained standing, and the hangar was lost and most 
of the ships damaged. Six months of hard work improving the Club's new home were 
lost in thirty seconds.<br>
<br>
The following day, Sunday November 6, a dozen members along with their spouses 
showed up to upright and move the gliders. Brian Evans and Peter Johnson did 
damage assessment estimates while others began disassembling the debris into 
stacks of materials that could be reused. This work continued past sunset, an 
indication the Club's members were going to see the Club through this disaster. 
Assisting in these efforts were Gary Bawtinhimer, Mitch Deutsch, Revel Freeman, 
Marty and Robin Pautz, Charles Pinson, Marsha and Mike Rossi, Ned States, Terri 
Tillman, Walt Valesky, Jack Wright and Jimmy Karlovich.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Almost immediately, John Karlovich stated the facility would be rebuilt, with 
some changes. The clubhouse would be a separate structure to be rebuilt on the 
existing slab and a pre-engineered meta sided wood hangar would be constructed 
just to the north of the clubhouse.</font></p>

<p align="center">And &quot;after!&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<br>
<b>DECEMBER 1988:</b><br>
Work proceeded rapidly to rebuild the clubhouse. As of mid-December, all the 
walls were erected, rafters installed and most of the plywood decking was laid. 
Much contribution was coming forward from the members, including an anonymous 
donor who agreed to match $2 for each $1 that was raised. With $6800 in the 
bank, the club was still a bit short needing about $3100 to complete the 
project, including the septic system, carpeting and water<br>
line.<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
<br>
Both Grobs were under repair, with the G103 at Bluffton to fix the tornado 
damage as well as install new spar spigots, as required by a Grob AD.&nbsp; The G102, 
having received approval from the insurance company for the repairs was in Brian 
Evans' shop in Cumming awaiting parts. With the breaks in the weather, members 
put over 30 hours and 100 flights on the newly arrived K21, whose arrival was 
possible due to a syndicate of members.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
JANUARY 1989<br>
With a spell of mild weather and high interest from members, the clubhouse 
project made great strides and was closed in, only eight weeks after the 
tornado.&nbsp; Approximately $7200 was raised and about $2600 was needed to complete 
the building.<br>
<br>
Construction for the new hangar was set began. The new hangar, 54' x 60' in 
size, was of a prefabricated design with wood trusses and columns and be 
sheathed in metal panels. It would also have a concrete floor making glider 
movement quite easy. A lean to glider barn was proposed for the north side.<br>
<br>
<b>MARCH 1989:</b><br>
After 31 consecutive weekends (going back to September 1988), the clubhouse was 
occupied. Though completion of numerous trim items and connection of essential 
services remained (septic tank, water, and electricity), the building was 
complete enough to occupy and to move some of the Club's furniture stored at the 
Johnson residence. The call also went out for members to search their attics and 
basements for furniture that would have a second life at the clubhouse.</font></p>

AL.</font></b></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<br>
The Club's success at the Ft Payne Mountain Camp was documented in detail in the 
Phoenix. Each day was truly different, offering thermals, ridge and wave 
conditions as well as the expedited day of inclement weather. Tows were provided 
by the Pawnee as well as by the &quot;Blue Bomber,&quot; the Club's Ford LTD tow vehicle. 
The most memorable day was Day 6. David Rice took an autotow to 1200 feet and 
connected into wave. The wind was picking up and the other pilots opted to use 
the Pawnee. Bobby Bridges and Mitch Deutsch played win the wave-laced skies for 
the entire afternoon and reached altitudes of 10,000 MSL. Mother nature provided 
a sky all day filled with numerous saucer shaped clouds. Most everybody stayed 
late with Mitch and&nbsp; Bobby landing just before dusk.<br>
<br>
John Karlovich began clearing to extend the runway approximately 500 feet to the 
north. ASC was to be featured in Atlanta Magazine and hoped to be in the Atlanta 
Business Chronicle.<br>
<br>
David Rice recounted his success in ridge flying at Etowah. A longer tow (only 
$37) to Johns Mountain, eighteen miles to the northwest provided David with a 
truly enjoyable afternoon of ridge soaring. With winds at 20 knots from the 
west, the north-south orientation of the ridge allowed David to fly his K6E 
about 500 feet above ridge top level at 60 knots for several round trips of the 
entire 20 mile length of the ridge. David initially planned to land at nearby 
Rome Airport for a aerotow back to Etowah, but he was able to climb to 5000 feet 
above Rome's airport and easily glide home, through alternate areas of sink and 
lift. This confirmed David's belief of the existence of several bars of wave 
between Etowah and Rome. This information would prove useful for other flights 
by David and other pilots in the next few years!<br>
<br>
<b>JANUARY 1991</b><br>
During the normally wet December, Larry Goddard managed to find some tolerable 
weather and earn his Private rating. The runway extension project made progress 
as Carl Melear and Carl Brunsman chain sawed the overgrowth on the western and 
northern boundaries of the extension while Mitch Deutsch and Rick Valley cleared 
the old road embankment just north of the proposed end of the runway to provide 
sufficient clearance for aircraft trying to land short. While a fair amount of 
the clearing has been done, a work party was called for later in the month to 
complete the project.<br>
<br>
The permanent barbeque grille north of the clubhouse was completed by RickValley 
and Ned States<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FEBRUARY 1991</b><br>
With the winter season in full force, David Rice, having earned the title of 
weather guru through his RAOBTOOL program as well as his research, offered two 
classes; one focusing&nbsp; on weather and a second class in cross country. 
Meanwhile, Joe Flores volunteered to head up a home study group for those 
studying to pass the FAA ground school test. Those attending the first meeting 
included Erick Baron, Michael Vaughn, Julia Robinson, Fred Ewing, Rich Lang, 
Jack Dunn and Tom Wyatt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Walt Valesky proposed a series of three two-hour 
ground courses on the FAR's.</font></p>

The SSA advised the FAA would exempt glider instructors and their clubs from the 
requirements of drug testing.&nbsp; Joe Flores and his friend John Ellis have 
constructed a new entrance sign made of colored synthetic stucco at the gravel 
road entrance from Hwy 411.<br>
<br>
Mitch Deutsch, Erick Baron, Joe Flores and Rick Valley gave a presentation on 
soaring to the Georgia Tech Flying Club. The video, &quot;Running on Empty&quot; was shown 
to an enthusiastic bunch of students and&nbsp; the club was invited back for a second 
presentation. Julia Robinson also arranged for print articles in the Atlanta 
Business Chronicle and Creative Loafing.<br>
<br>
The Club extended its condolences upon learning of the passing of longtime MGSA 
member Bob Grey. Bob had led the efforts for the SSA convention held in 1988.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SEPTEMBER 1991</b><br>
The autotow day was held at Rockmart, where Rick Valley, Dan Nugent, Jim 
Karlovich, Richard Keith, Mitch Deutsch, Bruce and Brian Wauer, Joe Flores, 
Erick Baron, Jason Shokey and Larry Goddard took turns flying and driving. 
During the afternoon, unfortunately the Club's autotow car, the Blue Bomber, 
died a final death and it was hauled back behind Erick Baron's pick up to 
Etowah&nbsp; where it will be relegated to migrate back to its original elements 
(rust to death).<br>
<br>
<b>OCTOBER 1991</b><br>
The club was making its last payment to the bank for the 102 and to commemorate 
the importance, lowered the rate to $15 per hour, provided $150 was put down as 
block time.<br>
<br>
The Club returned from a very successful mountain camp at Andrews-Murphy. The 
weather varied from day to day, with flying activities each day. The conditions 
at the middle of the week were less favorable though numerous practice patterns 
were made. Wave and thermal flights were made. Participating in the camp were 
visitors David Pixton, Roger Hinote, Duffy Snyder, John Barksdale, and John 
Wells. Club members included Erick Baron, David Tan, Marty Pautz, Charles Feyt, 
Paul Green Ned States, Richard Keith, Walt Valesky, Gary Harvey, Rick Valley, 
Carl Melear, Larry Goddard, Hans van der Maarel, Mitch Deutsch, David Rice, 
Fernando Silva and Ben<br>
Kololitin. A total of 200 hours of flight was logged in nine days.<br>
<br>
<b>FEBRUARY 1992</b><br>
The club presented a new organizational structure that was brought about due to 
a relatively dismal 1991 soaring season. The weather did not provide enough 
activity to produce the required revenues.&nbsp; The recession apparently cut back 
members' spending and the members apparently lost much of their enthusiasm for 
soaring. Something had to be done or else the club&nbsp; would have to cease 
operations and sell all its assets.<br>
<br>
The model the club used with two full time employees was based on a fair amount 
of cash flow and it became apparent this model would no longer work. With much 
sadness, the Club was forced to terminate Derek and Elsie Johnson as employees 
of the club.<br>
<br>
With the change-over in responsibilities, ASC sold back the Clubhouse to the 
Karloviches per the previous agreement and received a small payment, 
representing approximately one-third of the expense. The $5500 payment allowed 
the club to pay off some obligations and still retain some monies for operating 
the G102.<br>
<br>
The goal of the club was to provide more enjoyment at less cost. A summary of 
the new program is as follows:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The club will still fly at Etowah bend but would not pay field rent 
directly, having relinquished the exclusive control of all soaring operations at 
Etowah. All glider pilots would be able to fly at the field, regardless of club 
affiliation.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Club will no longer offer instruction, but this service will be 
provided by John Karlovich as a lowered rate.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The rental costs of the equipment would be reduced, with the K21 and G102 
costing $22.50 and $10.00 per hour respectively.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The $300 club dues fee would be reduced to $100. All pilots flying from 
Etowah Bend would also pay a $100 &quot;field use&quot; fee directly to the Karloviches. A 
system of providing credits to ASC members who had paid their dues well in 
advance was worked out so members would not have to pay both ASC and the 
Karloviches for the same fees.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Without paid staff, each member was advised they would have&nbsp; to pick up 
some of the tasks that previously were provided for them.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All towing fees would be payable directly to the Karloviches. Members would 
be on the honor system to pay for the ship usage by leaving a check in the 
lockbox in the clubhouse and also report their durations. Due to its cost and 
administrative efforts, the option of paying by credit card was eliminated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In line with other clubs, the advance booking system was replaced by a 
&quot;first come, first served&quot; system for the G102. The bookings for the K21 would 
be handled by Jimmy Karlovich, since he was handling the instruction.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Joe Flores' study group was meeting regularly. Attendees included Tag Hinter, 
Dan Nugent, Walt Smith, Erick Baron, Hans van den Maarel, Tony Jarl, Jack Agey, 
Richard Keith, Charles Feyt, Paul Green and Joe Flores. Assisting on the 
instructional side were Jack Dunn, Jimmy Karlovich and Alan Bobo.&nbsp; Jackie Agey 
managed his first solo and David Tan obtained his bronze badge.<br>
<br>
<b>MARCH 1992:</b><br>
Though the club remained operational under its new format from Wednesdays 
through Sundays, Alan Bobo and Jim Karlovich advised with prior arrangement, 
instruction and towing could be made available on Mondays and Tuesdays.</font></p>

<br>
<b>APRIL and MAY 1992:</b><br>
David Rice led a ground school class for cross country flight planning while Joe 
Flores' study group for the FAA private ticket was ongoing.<br>
<br>
Informal contests were scheduled every other Saturday, beginning on May 16.<br>
<br>
The G103 which previously had been operating in Florida, returned and would be 
made available by Etowah Bend Soaring at the same prices previously charged by 
ASC.&nbsp; The syndicate of ASC members that owned the K21 sold the<br>
ship. Unfortunately, ASC was in no financial position to buy it, but fortunately 
Jimmy Karlovich stepped in. Though the hourly rate was higher than previously 
charged, at least it remained at Etowah Bend.<br>
<br>
A &quot;rock party&quot; (better known as a &quot;rock removing party&quot;) was held on the morning 
of April 5, After a hearty breakfast prepared by Carl Brunsman that served at 
the field, the group (Joe Flores, Tony and Bill Clare, Julie and Peter Ouseley, 
Mitch Deutsch, Dan Nugent, Jimmy Karlovich, Tag Hunter, Dan Nugent, Kevin Kaylor 
and Carl Brunsman headed out to the northern part of the runway to clear away 
rocks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>MAY 1992 THROUGH JANUARY 1993</b><br>
Operations continued at Etowah Bend during this period with ASC coexisting with 
Etowah Bend Soaring for the glider activity.&nbsp; ASC tried to concentrate on the 
&quot;fun&quot; part of soaring (records, badges, contests, social events) while Etowah 
Bend Soaring dealt with providing tows and instruction as well as upkeep of the 
clubhouse and the facility in general.&nbsp; ASC had always wanted to be the major 
soaring operation at the field since it lost its &quot;exclusive rights&quot; a year 
earlier, but found itself unable to do so due in part to the overbearing 
presence Etowah Bend Soaring had at the field and general apathy from folks who 
did not want to get involved.<br>
<br>
<b>MARCH&nbsp; 1993</b><br>
With the start of spring, the 1993 Inter-Club Contest Schedule (also to be known 
as the Georgia Tennessee race series or GTA) was announced, with events 
scheduled at Monroe, Etowah Bend and Chilhowee, spaced about two<br>
weeks apart.<br>
<br>
<b>APRIL 1993:</b><br>
On the first day of April, ASC lost its prized possession, the G102 due to an 
accident. The pilot, Joe Flores, was not seriously injured, by the ship was 
totaled. Now the club found itself at another crossroads- what to do next. 
Etowah Bend Soaring was about to reduce their fleet to two 2 seaters and there 
were several options; liquidate, replace the ship with another single seater or 
buy a two seater. A meeting was scheduled for May 8 to hash out the issues and 
build consensus.<br>
<br>
The Georgia Tennessee race series contest held at Etowah Bend on April 17 and 18 
had fantastic weather with bases as high as 8600 feet AGL. Thirteen participants 
enjoyed the 7 knot lift. On the 17th, Gilly Smith and David Rice finished first 
in the A and B Classes, respectively . On the 18th, Dave Stevenson and David 
Rice finished first in the A and B Classes, respectively.<br>
<br>
SSA advised a new &quot;electronic bulletin board&quot; was available to pilots at no 
charge, though it took a long distance call to log on.&nbsp; It was surmised in the 
newsletter that electronic forms of communications would be how members in sport 
related clubs could easily communicate!<br>
<br>
<b>MAY 1993:</b><br>
Dan Nugent earned his private rating and Jim Williams purchased Don Runyon's old 
ship, the K8.<br>
<br>
With the loss of ASC's only asset, the Club held a special meeting on May 8 to 
gather consensus on what to do next. Seventeen of the nineteen attendees 
acknowledged that the G102 should be replaced by another ship, preferably a two 
seater. And, members advised they were willing to put in additional personal 
effort in the club's operations. Nonetheless, the Club's mode of operation was 
needing to change, partly due to the loss of the G102 and more so to the 
ever-changing political winds at Etowah Bend. It was clear, however, the club 
members needed to take a more active role in the operation of the facility in 
order for soaring to survive. The new plan would operate much like a &quot;regular&quot; 
club does and would theoretically spread the operational burden on more members. 
It would then be up to each member to help as much as possible.<br>
<br>
The new structure was drafted and would be presented formally to the member at 
the June meeting.<br>
<br>
Etowah Bend's responsibilities:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Maintain the facility and provide tows</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Have available aircraft maintenance and inspection services</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Each pilot would still pay Etowah an annual $100 fee to use the facilities</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Private owners need not join ASC but must still pay the field use fee<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ASC's responsibilities:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Full responsibility to run the soaring operation, except tows and initially 
instruction.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Provide a two pace ship- Blanik to be 
  purchased.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Instruction eventually to be provided by ASC members. In the interim, 
Etowah Bend will provide instructors, and each member would be responsible to 
arrange his own instruction and glider availability. Instructional fees would 
then be negotiated, but guidelines will be provided by the Club.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All glider related activities (contests, seminars, socials) to be handled 
by ASC</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Rides, barographs and soaring materials to be made available at modest 
cost.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Provide a premises insurance policy</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Annual membership fee to be $150, of which $50 will be credited against 
rental fees for using club ship(s).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The club would collect the tow fees</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">On a rotating basis, each member would have to be either a FOO&nbsp; (Field 
Operations Officer) to coordinate the day's glider activity or man the office 
and phone and perform administrative duties, such as collecting monies.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
<b>JUNE 1993:</b><br>
At the June 5th meeting, members approved the purchase if a L-13 Blanik from 
Chris Smission. The good thing was the ship was already on site and its use 
could begin immediately. The new operations scheme was presented to all the 
members and received full support.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SEPTEMBER 1993:</b><br>
On September, 25, the club hosted the Georgia/Tennessee (G/T) race series 
banquet. This all day event featured fun flying and a contest. Later in the 
afternoon, G/T awards (etched glass) were handed out by Jim Hogue and was 
followed by dinner on the grille. All local clubs were invited to join. Visiting 
pilots included Gilly Smith, Glenn Lawler and Harold Buck. Next year soaring 
sites in Alabama will be formally included in the series<br>
<br>
The owners of the AS-K21 wished to sell. Though the club was in better financial 
shape and could afford a couple of the twenty five shares priced at $1000 each, 
it could definitely not afford to buy a majority. Help was asked of the soaring 
community to purchase the K21 and provide it back to the club on leaseback. Jack 
Agey, Carl Scheidt and Don Runyon earned their private ratings. Steve Miller 
soloed in the Club's Blanik. Chris Ruf and jack Agey manned a booth at an 
airshow at the West Georgia Regional Airport on September 24. Chris Smisson flew 
glider aerobatics.<br>
<br>
<b>OCTOBER 1993:</b><br>
Five ASC members and the Club formed a partnership to keep the K21 at Etowah 
Bend. The partnership included Mike Katopes, Chuck Patterson, Tom Spier, Conrad 
Suechting and Bruce Wauer and ASC.<br>
<br>
The political winds began to shift again at Etowah Bend and tensions were 
growing between the Club and with Etowah Bend Soaring, and specifically with 
Jerry Wilson who self appointed himself as Etowah Bend's sole representative in 
matters dealing with the club. It appeared&nbsp; Wilson thought and convinced the 
other Etowah Bend principals the club was making all sorts of money and somehow 
felt they were due their share.&nbsp; The Karloviches, Jimmy and John, apparently 
gave Wilson their tacit approval to act as their representative as it appeared 
the Karloviches did not want to<br>
get directly involved in these matters.<br>
<br>
Though the Club felt it has met every contractual obligation in its agreements 
with Etowah Bend, it seemed that was not good enough and it appeared Wilson's 
goal was to see the club fail. In a demand letter to ASC, Wilson demanded 
immediate compliance with a list of written demands and a meeting with the 
property owners or the club would be asked to leave.<br>
<br>
In a memo to the Board of Directors by Mitch Deutsch, it was suggested the only 
practical way to solve these issues may be to seek another location to fly from. 
Wilson appeared to have the Karloviches' respective ears and no amount of 
negotiation was going to resolve the tension.<br>
<br>
A meeting was held with Wilson and the Karloviches and since the Club could not 
immediately identify all its options, the club capitulated to all their demands. 
The leaders of the Club knew sooner or later that ASC would have to leave Etowah 
Bend in order to be able to run its operation to the best benefit of its members 
and not be under the capricious and arbitrary whims present at Etowah Bend.<br>
<br>
For the time being, the Board would try to keep things running and present the 
positive side to its members.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FEBRUARY TO MARCH 1994:</b><br>
The Karloviches advised they wished to pursue other projects and ventures and to 
was mutually agreed between the Club and Etowah bend that the club would leave 
Etowah Bend by the end of March 1994.<br>
<br>
The Club's Board of Directors actively investigated a number of solutions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dissolution: Made no sense as the members would not be able to continue 
their flying and the cash proceeds would have to be given to a like 
organization. Too many people worked too long for that option to be considered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relocate to another airport: The Club would then have to negotiate a place 
to fly and arrange for a tow service. The club did not have the financial 
strength to do this and a general lack of commitment from its members for such a 
venture was not present. The disruption would likely cause a huge attrition in 
the membership.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge with the Mid-Georgia Soaring Association (MGSA): After several 
meetings with representatives of MGSA, it was learned the clubs had very similar 
goals and purposes. Discussions then led to an understanding that the proposed 
merger would greatly benefit both organizations<br>
<br>
The advantages of the merger were:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGSA was a mature club in the operational sense and was well into the 
social aspects relating to soaring.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two groups were roughly the same size and would complement each other.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of flying would go down as MGSA charged no flying fees.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There would be a combined pool of six sailplanes (Two Blaniks, a Grob 103 
Acro, Grob 102, 1-34 and a AS-K21)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The training program would continue as more potential instructors were 
available.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Monroe site had been home to soaring for over thirty yeas and was as 
secure as a club could be at a public field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MGSA's focus on cross country. Contests and badges would provide new goals 
for ASC's membership<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASC's physical assets would be protected and ASC would retain the 
camaraderie.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flying would continue with no interruptions.<br>
<br>
The disadvantages of the proposed merger:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loss of Etowah Bend as a soaring site was inescapable as ASC was told 
to leave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the members would need to drive further: Not a really big issue if 
one wanted to soar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a merger, the ASC name would be lost: Once the purpose of ASC was 
understood, it would be realized the surviving organization would provide the 
same goals and provide better services.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some members will leave the club: If the club did not relocate and merge, 
all the members would in fact be forced to leave as the club would then be 
dissolved.<br>
<br>
Jeff White, owner of EFX, a Grob 102, graciously donated his ship and its 
trailer to ASC. Over the years, Mr. White donated thousands of dollars and many, 
many hours of his expertise so the Club could operate. This latest donation 
would give the Club the financial resources to be considered as an &quot;equal&quot; with 
its new merger partner, MGSA.<br>
<br>
The ASC Board of Directors at its February 22 meeting unanimously voted to 
pursue a merger with MGSA. A meeting was scheduled for March 12 for presentation 
and voting by the ASC members. Members that could not be present were asked to 
provide a proxy.<br>
<br>
<b>MARCH 1994:</b><br>
On March 12, 2994 members of both Clubs unanimously approved the merger of the 
two clubs into one organization, the Mid-Georgia Soaring Association.<br>
<br>
The details of the merger:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All current members of ASC were eligible to join MGSA with no initiation 
fee. All ASC members were asked to promptly fill out a MGSA membership form and 
send it to Allen Douglas, the MGSA president. On March 23, MGSA scheduled a 
special meeting to accept the membership applications of the ASC members.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASC members would receive a refund of unused ASC dues and monies on 
account. MGSA would then invoice the new members for annual MGSA dues, prorated 
for the calendar year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was hoped that Etowah Bend would refund the field use fee on a pro rata 
basis, but neither soaring Club would have control of Etowah Bend's actions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each new MGSA member would be asked to participate in their capital funding 
program (NIRCU) that had purchased the Pawnee. The fee would be either a one 
time $500 fee, refundable once the program was finished, or an<br>
annual $50 fee.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the owners of the K21 voted, the ship could be sold to MGSA (ASC voted 
to have its share sold to MGSA, but the remaining members of the group did not. 
ASC's share of the K21 was purchased by the remainder of the<br>
group).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each new member of MGSA would required to be Operations Director (OD) for 
two days per year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instruction would be provided by MGSA members for a flat fee of $100 for 
power transition and $350 for ab-initio training. Those currently in the ASC 
training program would likely benefit from reduced fees.<br>
<br>
As this history is being written from December 2001 through March 2002, it is 
the writer's observation that the merger has helped provide a very strong and 
mature club, with a solid financial standing. I never would have dreamt on 
February 11, 1986 that such a great and wonderful future would have existed!</font></p>
