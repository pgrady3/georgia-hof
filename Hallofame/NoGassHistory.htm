<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="arial,helvetica">The North Georgia Soaring 
Society, affectionately known as NoGass,&nbsp; was born July 1, 1954 at Fulton County 
Airport.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jack Dunn and John Karlovich had started the Memphis 
Soaring Association in 1953, and when they were furloughed from the airlines in 
1954, they moved to Atlanta where Jack Dunn started a business, Southeast 
Airmotive, at the Fulton County Airport.&nbsp; They brought with them John's 
Pratt-Read 2-place, side-by-side glider which had been highly modified at Miss. 
State University.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 1929 Baker-McMillen Cadet was purchased from 
Hendersonville, NC and a Kinner Sportster w/ 125 HP Kinner engine towplane was 
added to the inventory as well.&nbsp; John Karlovich, a few months later, moved to 
Starkville, MS where he went to work for the noted aeronautics guru, Dr. Gus 
Raspet at Miss. State University.<span>&nbsp; </span>His Pratt-Read was left in 
Atlanta for the Club to use.</font></p>

were:&nbsp; Charlie Sparks, T.F. Murray, Mel Barret, Jack Dunn, Bob Rust, Wallace 
Hudson, Lloyd Harris, Tom Townsend, Lou Whinnery, W.M. Johnston, Ed Barnes, 
Rhonda Satterfield, Steve Snyder (guest member from Philidelphia), and John 
McReynolds.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">The first NoGass newsletter 
went out in October, 1954 and at the time the members were busy learning soaring 
and getting their glider ratings.&nbsp; Jack Dunn served as the flight instructor and 
that fall he was authorized by the FAA to give flight checks.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
club was quite busy working on the ships and keeping them airworthy.&nbsp; </font>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">The Pratt Read was nicknamed 
&quot;Bo Diddy&quot; and was the pride and joy of the Club. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">Spring of 1955 found the Club 
active in local soaring flights and increasing activity.&nbsp; Then on May 7, 1955 
the Club's Pratt Read &quot;Bo Diddy&quot; was lost.<span>&nbsp; </span>A new &quot;visiting&quot; glider 
pilot from the Philadelphia Glider Council, who was attending Ga. Tech, was 
flying on his 2<sup>nd</sup> solo flight in the bird.&nbsp; At that time, there was a 
courtesy agreement that members of one club would accept other club members as 
their own.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Tech student attempted the daring stunt of making a 
high-speed pass under the Chattahoochee River bridge that was just off the end 
of runway 8.&nbsp; He cleared the bridge with several feet to spare on each wingtip 
as well as above and below the fuselage.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, when he 
attempted the pull up to head for the runway, he clipped a tree limb that was 
overhanging the river with the right wing tip and &quot;Bo Diddy&quot; was cart wheeled 
into the trees and destroyed.&nbsp; Luckily, the pilot was not injured, but the Club 
members almost wrung his neck!<span>&nbsp; </span>About this same time, the Club's 
&quot;spark plug&quot; Jack Dunn closed his business on the airport and went to work for 
Lockheed.&nbsp; With this sudden change of events, the NoGass Club ceased activity 
and became dormant for several years.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ironically, the petition to 
incorporate &quot;North Georgia Soaring Society, Inc.&quot; was approved on May 10, 1955, 
just as the Club was heading for dormancy.&nbsp; The Kinner Sportster towplane was 
sold to a man in the DC area for $1,000.00.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica"><b>1959-1962</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">In 1959, John Karlovich had 
returned to Atlanta and he and Jack Dunn organized a meeting on November 14, 
1959 at Parkaire Field in Marietta to reorganize the NoGass Club.&nbsp; Parkaire 
Field was located at the intersection of Johnson Ferry Road and Lower Roswell 
Road, where Parkaire Mall now resides.<span>&nbsp; </span>John Karlovich and Jack 
Dunn served as temporary co-chairmen of this original meeting.&nbsp; It was decided 
to reform the group with an initiation fee of $100.00 and annual dues of $20.00, 
which included SSA dues.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">Original members of this 
reactivated NoGass Club were:&nbsp; Larry and Betsy Weaver, Cecil Alexander (the 
architect who designed the new Ga. State Flag in 2001), John Wallace, Ed Barnes, 
Vernon Harris, Herbert Muncy, Bill Hoelzer, Paul Tappan, Philip Edgerton, Ray 
Carter, James Gonia, Walter Nix (the owner of Parkaire Field), Jack Dunn, John 
and Audrey Karlovich, Al Barrett, William Flower, Chuck Mahay, Joe Stewart, 
Robert Wylie, J.A. Sandman, Wallace Crichton, L.K. Williges, and Ted Herron.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">The first officers were:&nbsp; 
President-Jack Dunn, Vice President-Larry Weaver, Secretary-Betsy Weaver, 
Treasurer-Bill Hoelzer.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">The original Directors were:&nbsp; 
Walter Nix, Ed Barnes, John Karlovich, Phil Edgerton, and Herbert Muncy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="arial,helvetica">The Club immediately 
purchased a Schweizer 2-22 in Laurel, Miss. for $2,000.00.&nbsp; A flying fee of 3 
cents a minute and a tow fee of $1.00 per thousand feet was established.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Walter Nix agreed to let the Club operate at Parkaire Field.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">In December of 1959, the Club 
was granted SSA Chapter status.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="arial,helvetica">In April 1960, the Club 
purchased its tow plane, a Meyers OTW-160 biplane.&nbsp; John and Audrey Karlovich 
picked it up in Dallas and flew it back to Atlanta.<span>&nbsp; </span>The biplane 
was also available for pleasure flying by qualified members at a rate of 20 
cents per minute.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">By June 1960, the following 
new members had joined the Club:&nbsp; Bob Beavers, Colie Whittaker, Bob Thurmon, 
Wallace Hudson, Roy Reynolds, Bob Rust, and Charlie Sparks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">The first soaring contest in 
Georgia was held over the Memorial Day weekend, 1960.&nbsp; John Karlovich organized 
the 3<sup>rd</sup> Annual Jim Swearengen Memorial Contest, normally held in 
Memphis, and held it at McCollum Airport in Kennesaw.&nbsp; Maximum altitude gained 
and spot landing contests were included.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jack Dunn borrowed John 
Karlovich's BG-7 glider, and in an attempt to squeeze every bit of performance 
out of the ship, decided to tape up the canopy gaps along the fuselage.&nbsp; Once up 
at altitude, Jack was surprised to find the canopy frosted over due to his 
breath on the cold surface and a lack of ventilation now that the canopy and 
cockpit was sealed up.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had some anxious moments flying around 
without being able to see outside!&nbsp; Eventually he managed to get a small area on 
the canopy cleared and managed to land without incident.<span>&nbsp; </span></font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">In September 1960, Ed Barnes 
became President of the NoGass Club.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">Starting in 1961 NoGass began 
to operate occasionally at McCollum Airport in addition to Parkaire.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">At the February 1961 meeting 
discussion was held of the prospect of merging the NoGass Club and the Mid 
Georgia Soaring Assoc. Club, which was based in Macon at the time.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">During the winter of 1961, the 
Club moved its operations to a small private strip, Jackoay's &quot;cow pasture&quot; 
airport, in Fort Payne, Alabama to take advantage of &quot;superb&quot; ridge souring 
during the winter months.&nbsp; The MGSA group from Macon joined NoGass in this 
activity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gliders that were based there during the winter were 
Karlovich's BG-7, John Wallace's L-K, NoGass's 2-22, and the MGSA 1-26 and L-K.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">During the winter of 1962, 
NoGass conducted operations at Andrews, NC along with the MGSA Club.&nbsp; The two 
clubs took advantage of some great ridge and wave flying conditions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On Feb. 10, 1962, Len Bachtel of the MGSA club rode the wave to 11,000 in 
his 1-23 on the first trip up there.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">In the Spring of 1962 the 
Club's 2-22 was flipped and destroyed in a windstorm at Parkaire and as a 
result, flying activity was severely curtailed.&nbsp; In the late Spring of 1962 the 
NoGass Club and MGSA Club were merged and continued to operate from Parkaire 
Field under the MGSA name.<span>&nbsp; </span>Later the &quot;combined&quot; Club moved to the 
Monroe, GA airport.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">During the mid 1980's, the 
NoGass name was revived when a few loose cannon in the North Atlanta metro area 
started flying gliders up in Canton, and mainly at Pickens Country Airport at 
Jasper.&nbsp; They reverted to auto towing everything just as soon as the guy with a towplane got tired of sitting around for another tow after the one, two, or 
three gliders were launched.<span>&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica">The NoGass revival crew was 
Jim Culp, Brian Evans, Peter King, and student Mark Ritter.&nbsp; They had various 
gliders from time to time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Including Jim's LS3a, a 2-33 bought by 
an angel but soon destroyed by a windstorm while tied out, a borrowed L-K which 
only did a few flights, an occasional repaired glider like a Diamant being &quot;test 
flown for airworthiness return to service&quot; by Brian after his glider shop 
repairs, and the glorious, red bodied, yellow winged, NoGass Ka-8, the greatest 
auto tow glider of them all.&nbsp; The Club continued for a while with the Ka-8 until 
the group decided to disband in 1989.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Ka-8 was sold to John 
Karlovich for use at his Etowah Bend glider port where the Atlanta Soaring Club 
was operating</font></p>
