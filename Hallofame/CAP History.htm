<p><font face="Arial">At the Soaring Society of America annual convention at 
Huntsville, Alabama in 1996, an announcement was made that an agreement had been 
reached between Civil Air Patrol and SSA to work together to make soaring flight 
available to the youth of America. SSA called on all of the State Governors to 
reach out to their respective CAP Wing Commanders to work in this direction.<br>
<br>
The SSA Governor for Georgia was Charlie Meason, and he began to visit various 
squadron meetings around metro Atlanta. He received some positive response from 
members of the Lawrenceville, Ga. squadrons, especially Captain David Reynolds, 
and LTC Will Hargrove. Later, he met Capt. John Rudio , commander of the Winder, 
Ga. squadron. Rudio was highly receptive, and arranged for a dozen of his cadets 
to receive glider rides in the MGSA two seat aircraft one Saturday afternoon. A 
similar event took place at LaGrange, Ga., when Southern Eagles Soaring club 
gave winch launch rides to cadets from the Peachtree-Dekalb squadron. MGSA 
President George Nuse was enthusiastic, but concerned that the club could be 
overwhelmed by such enthusiastic kids descending on the club operations. Other 
members were openly opposed to non-members using the club equipment, so a better 
way needed to be found to accommodate the demand from these youngsters.<br>
<br>
In January of 1997, Meason joined the CAP squadron at Winder, and soon met the 
Group 2 commander, Major Henry Hall. At Meason's suggestion, Henry approached 
Major John Sharp at CAP National Headquarters about the possibility of CAP 
providing a glider to the Georgia Wing to start a glider program. John was 
immediately supportive, and asked Meason to submit a formal request to purchase 
a new glider. After much deliberation, Meason decided that a Blanik L-23 would 
be a good ship to use in this program, and wrote a proposal around use of this 
model.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Meason began recruiting MGSA members to work in the program. 
Michael Wegner was the first to volunteer, followed by Bill Provine, Hartley 
Falbaum, Wayne Hoover, and Tom Wyatt. Around this time Meason met Capt. Darrell 
Golliher who was at the time a member of the Gwinnett squadron, but was 
interested in forming a squadron in Monroe. Since it was intended that the 
glider program would operate from Monroe, all MGSA members joined this new 
squadron. Several member's children also joined, including Marcus Wegner, Andrew 
Provine, and Rachel Meason.<br>
<br>
While all of this was going on, Meason and the other new MGSA/CAP members were 
meeting the CAP principals, whose support was imperative. Col. Ben Grove was the 
Georgia Wing commander, and it was his approval of this effort which got us over 
the first hurdle. From there, the CAP National Board's approval was necessary, 
as this was the first time an undertaking such as this was attempted. John Sharp 
was relentless in pushing our proposal through CAP channels. The proposal was 
sent through US Air Force channels, and even on to the Pentagon before it had 
all the necessary signatures. John Sharp finally notified Meason that an order 
had been placed with Vitek Siroky of Blanik America for a new Super Blanik L-23. 
He even sent along a copy of the check which had paid for the aircraft. In 
August of 1997, Charlie Meason, John Sharp, Henry Hall, Calvin Stribling, and 
his son Jason Stribling traveled to the docks at Charleston, SC to bring the new 
CAP Blanik home to Monroe, Ga.<br>
<br>
While awaiting approval of the purchase, a new Georgia Wing commander took over, 
Col. Chris Franklin. Chris was totally supportive of our efforts, and it was his 
backing which encouraged other CAP members to volunteer to help us. Capt. Lyle 
Letteer, Lt. Jean-Pierre Guillaume, LTC Lep Babin, Capt. Charlie Clements, Major 
Jim McCloud, LTC Lee Arnold, LTC Shirley Arnold and others helped out in many 
ways. Around this time, LTC George Harrison, a retired USAF Major General, 
joined Georgia Wing, and asked to be a part of our program. Shortly after 
receiving the L-23, John Sharp received approval from Col. Glen Atwell at CAP 
headquarters to send us a CAP Cessna 182 to equip as a glider towplane.<br>
<br>
In December of 1997, a formal rollout ceremony was held at the Monroe airport to 
show off the new L-23. Georgia Wing cadets had submitted suggestions in a &quot;Name 
the Glider&quot; contest. The winner would get the first &quot;official&quot; flight while the 
crowd watched at the rollout ceremony. The winning name was &quot;Silent Eagle&quot; 
submitted by cadet Daniel Carper of the Winder squadron. In January of 1998, the 
C-182 began towing operations.<br>
<br>
The program was envisioned as a way to give glider orientation flights to 
cadets, and flight training. On nearly every weekend for the next several years, 
CAP cadets were flying thousands of glider sorties. In June of 1998, the first 
Glider National Flight Academy was held at the Pine Mountain airport. Fourteen 
cadets from around the country received glider flight training for 10 days. 
Charlie Meason was the Activity Director, assisted by Instructors George 
Harrison, Bob Davis, John Sharp, Lyle Letteer, Bill Provine, Hartley Falbaum, 
and Tom Wyatt. Jim McCloud gave ground instruction, and many others assisted in 
many ways. Towpilot Jeff Cloud started a long tradition of selfless volunteerism 
which inspires everyone who knows him. Chris Franklin and Jean-Pierre Guillaume 
rounded out the towpilot staff.<br>
<br>
The program was used as a test program for CAP on a National basis. John Sharp 
used our activities to justify a request to purchase 20 additional gliders to be 
based all over the country. This proposal was approved, and the first of these 
new L-23s was delivered to Georgia Wing just in time for the 1999 Glider 
National Flight Academy at Pine Mountain. This time 22 cadets attended, and 
Meason had now become an instructor. David Mauritson of Tuscaloosa, Alabama 
joined the staff, as did towpilot Perry Vaughn of Columbus, Ga. The attending 
cadets named the new L-23 &quot;American Spirit&quot; at the conclusion of the event.<br>
<br>
In the Fall of 1999, we began to talk about requesting a single place glider 
since we now had many cadets who had received their glider ratings, or were past 
solo. To keep the fleet standardized, we requested a Blanik L-33. Approval was 
granted to look for and buy a used L-33. We purchased Wayne Hoover's beautiful 
L-33, which was based in Atlanta already. <br>
<br>
Another Glider National Flight Academy was held at Pine Mountain in June, 2000, 
attended by another 22 cadets. Jim Culp was a valuable addition this year. By 
this time, the people at the Pine Mountain airport had become close friends, and 
strong supporters of soaring and Civil Air Patrol. The arrival of the gliders 
and CAP cadets was a looked-forward-to event each June. What was really unique 
about the Georgia program is that after the National Flight Academies were over, 
the program continued year-round at Monroe. In order to make the gliders 
available to more cadets not close to Monroe, we started to aerotow the gliders 
to outlying locations and give flights nearer the cadets in remote areas. George 
Harrison, John Sharp, Charlie Meason, and Jean-Pierre made several of these 
trips.<br>

<br>
Back in Monroe, we had trained a number of cadets past solo, and several to 
their Private pilot ratings. Cadets Robert Kramer, Rachel Meason, Kevin 
Anderson, and Markus Wegner all earned their FAA ratings. Rachel Meason was 
Georgia Wing Cadet of the Year in 2000, as was Kevin Anderson in 2001. Kevin has 
gone on to the USAF Academy. All of these cadets are also MGSA members. In 2001, 
cadet George Sapp also joined MGSA. It could easily be demonstrated that the 
goal of getting more youth into soaring was working.<br>
<br>
John Sharp had also been talking about buying &quot;tow specific&quot; aircraft to be used 
at all of the programs which were now sprouting around the country. It was 
decided to seek approval to buy new Maule MT-7-235 aircraft. Again, the CAP 
National Board approved the purchase of 15 of these aircraft, and the first was 
delivered to Georgia Wing in early 2001. In early 2001, the Georgia Wing Glider 
program fleet consisted of 2 Blanik L-23s, a Blanik L-33, a C-182, and a Maule 
MT-7-235. Charlie Meason stepped down as Director of Glider Operations in April, 
2001. Chris Franklin assumed direction of the program, and continues it today.<br>
