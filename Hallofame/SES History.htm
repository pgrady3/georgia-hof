<p>They Came from Alabama</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="2">
<p><font face="Arial">By Stephen Lindenbaum, life member and former president,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">and Dr. Henry Baker, founding member and former president, 
Southern Eagles Soaring Club</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Soaring in the early 1990s southeastern United States 
existed in pockets. There were active clubs east of Atlanta, in the Birmingham 
and Huntsville areas, plus a well-known commercial operation east of 
Chattanooga. Most of these were a long drive for the soaring enthusiast at 
Auburn University so in late 1991 plans were made to form a new club in central 
eastern Alabama. The three people with this vision were Glenn Lawler, a 
restaurateur from Auburn, Dr. Henry Baker, a professor from Auburn University, 
and George Kling, a pilot with the aviation department at the university. Other 
who helped in the beginning were J. B Stokely, Michael Kamen (the first SES 
instructor) and Charles Bell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Glenn and Henry were already active in the restoration and 
flying of sailplanes. They had refinished an ASW-15 and Glenn was working on an 
LS-3a. Henry was also building a Woodstock. The group decided they needed a 
two-seater to start the club. After some searching, they settled on a Schleicher 
Ka-7 from Oklahoma. They brought the ship back in January 1992. Southern Eagles 
Soaring was incorporated in the state of Alabama in May of that year. Later that 
year, they decided to add a single-place Schleicher Ka-8b to the fleet. Glenn 
and George brought one back from up north.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The next issues to address were where to fly and how to 
launch. Glenn owned a 180 horsepower Cessna 175 he and Glen Adkins were slowly 
converting to a towplane. With the towplane not yet being ready the decision was 
made to ground launch using an auto-pulley tow. They had “borrowed” a pulley for 
auto-pulley launching when they bought the Ka-7. It was obvious that Auburn 
airport would be unsuitable due to traffic congestion, but just down the road 
was the little-used 5000-foot runway of Moton-Anderson airport in Tuskegee. This 
airport was once one of two training fields for the famous Tuskegee Airmen of 
World War II. Tuskegee appeared to be ideal. They began “experimenting” with 
auto launching. Glenn taught himself how to fly auto launches while Henry and 
George taught themselves how to fly the tow car. (Actually Glenn went to Germany 
for a week and was checked out for ground launch on a winch.) After several 
heart-stopping episodes, they declared themselves expert and ready to conduct 
ground launch clinics for licensed glider pilots.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This still left one final problem. They needed an 
instructor to teach new students and qualify members for ground launch. They did 
not know of a local instructor with a ground launch endorsement. Glenn knew 
Steve Lindenbaum, an instructor with the Lockheed Soaring Club flying at 
Chilhowee, who had no restrictions on his instructor’s license. Glenn contacted 
Steve and made arrangements to hold a ground-launch clinic weekend at Chilhowee 
in November 1992. They would do auto-pulley tows on the 2600-foot grass strip to 
qualify pilots for ground launching. Designated Pilot Examiner Mike Reisman 
agreed to sign off pilots graduating from the clinic to have their aero-tow-only 
restrictions removed. To assist the fledgling club do as many ground launch 
check-outs as possible, the Lockheed Soaring Club added their L-13 Blanik to the 
SES Ka-7 for the weekend. Glenn and Steve together flew over sixty launches 
during the two-day period. Many pilots were approved for ground lunch. One of 
the first to go through was David McGaughey who later joined Southern Eagles as 
an instructor in 1993. Under David’s tutelage, a formal instruction program was 
established making SES a true teaching club. The club has never lost sight of 
the need to have a training program for new members in order to remain a 
healthy, growing organization. Southern Eagles Soaring was off and flying.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">More members joined. Soaring was good at Tuskegee. In the 
pursuit of higher, more powerful tows, Glenn built a truck-mounted two-drum 
winch to rival the best from Germany. Patterned after the winches Glenn had seen 
during his visits to Germany, Henry commented, “theirs were Mercedes, but ours 
was pure Detroit”.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">One problem continued to plague the club - lack of a 
hangar. Each weekend the club would trailer their two sailplanes onto the 
airport and assemble them. Each evening they would take them apart and put them 
back on the trailers. This was taking a toll on the membership and they realized 
the need to be able to keep at least the Ka-7 assembled. No hangars were 
available at Tuskegee but there was plenty of land available, so they approached 
the airport management about building a hangar. They were refused. They knew 
they had to move or parish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The chief flight instructor at the light-aircraft fixed 
base operation at Tuskegee, Jacob Luitjens, decided to move his operation, 
AirVentures, Inc., to a large empty hangar in LaGrange, Georgia. Through Jacob, 
the soaring club found out: 1. The airport management at LaGrange wanted to 
increase their operations count to better qualify for federal airport funding 
and 2. There was space available in the AirVentures hangar for the gliders. The 
SES officers met with the LaGrange airport management and a verbal agreement was 
struck. In 1997 Southern Eagles Soaring moved to LaGrange. They brought Glenn’s 
winch but realized that because of the cross-runway layout, it would be 
impractical for launching. Local airport management felt that a wire hanging in 
the air near the powered aircraft traffic pattern was a safety issue. Glenn, in 
the meantime, finished the towplane for the club to use. Soon that became the 
method of choice for lunching.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The history of Southern Eagles Soaring would be incomplete 
without the mention of a silent benefactor. A quiet, unassuming, retired 
industrialist from Columbus, Georgia, and an avid sailplane pilot and collector, 
Harold Buck provided much needed capital through the early days of SES. Harold 
came to Tuskegee for a ground launch in his Ventus in November of 1992. He was 
so impressed he joined the club and became Vice-President the next year. It 
would probably be impossible to list all of the support and contributions Harold 
made to SES and to soaring in general. He was a truly remarkable man. In 1995, 
Harold made available to SES pilots two sailplanes from his collection - an 
Italian-designed, French-built M-200 two-seater and a Schweizer 1-26 for the 
cost of insurance. Upon his death in the late 1990’s, Harold bequeathed them to 
SES. The M-200 was sold to a syndicate of SES members to raise capital. The 1-26 
continued operating as a second club single-seater.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">By the end of the decade, the club had reached more than 
30 members. Membership was becoming diverse, with two-thirds coming from the 
Atlanta area. Other members came from as far away as Montgomery, Alabama. As the 
club grew, it was recognized that it needed to be wean itself off the financial 
dependence on individual members as much as possible. The club agreed to buy the 
towplane from Glenn in 2000. Several members worked on it to install a new STOL 
conversion kit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The following year it was obvious that a new two-seater 
was needed to replace the now tired Ka-7. The Ka-7, sometimes called “Mother 
Goose”, had taught a multitude of students to soar including Tim McGowen, the 
first SES student to learn soaring from scratch in the club back in 1993. To 
raise capital, the 1-26 was sold to a former member now living out west. After 
what proved to be an international search by several SES members, an L-23 Super 
Blanik was located in Canada. With a loan from a dozen SES members, the ship was 
secured in mid-summer of 2001.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">That same year two SES members, following in the spirit of 
Harold Buck, offered their Ka-6CR to the club for rated pilots to fly in 
exchange for insuring and hangaring it. The fleet now included a modern trainer, 
two fun-to-fly single-seaters and a towplane. The club had a solid foundation on 
which to grow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In May 2002, Southern Eagles will see its tenth birthday. 
One of the original members is still in the club. The membership includes five 
instructors and many tow pilots. The skies above are blue and the future ahead 
looks bright.</font></p>
