<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="5">MID-GEORGIA SOARING ASSOCIATION&nbsp; 
HISTORY</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">By Clyde Taylor</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In November, 1959, Mid-Georgia Soaring Association was 
incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia in Macon, Bibb County, 
Georgia, by its’ founders, Captain Linford B. Bachtell, USAF, and Van Thaxton, 
presently retired and living in Warner Robins, Georgia. MGSA sprang from the 
Warner Robins Aero Club, which was originally organized by Van Thaxton, its’ 
first president. Interest in soaring in the Aero Club began in early 1958 when 
Capt. Lin Bachtell was assigned to Robins Air Force Base. An Air Force fighter 
pilot, he was also an enthusiastic soaring pilot, owned a Schweizer 1-23 and 
stimulated interest in soaring among Aero Club members. As an informal soaring 
club, MGSA became an SSA Chapter prior to its’ formal incorporation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Aero Club soaring activity at first involved Lin 
Bachtell’s personal 1-23, which was flown by the members with a soaring 
orientation. As interest grew in soaring, a trip was made to Dayton, Ohio, where 
an LK-10A was purchased for the fledgling soaring club. Operations were from 
Cochran Field, now Macon Municipal Airport. Tows were provided by Aero Club 
members with towhook-equipped aircraft. Often, North Georgia Soaring Association 
(NOGASS) members from Parkaire Field in Cobb County, came to Macon to fly. Other 
original members were Ken Grubbs of Monroe, Bill Brown of Athens, Matt Conner, 
and Charlie Sparks, all of whom drove from Atlanta or the Monroe / Athens area 
to participate. By 1960, MGSA had approximately twenty members and was operating 
three sailplanes, the LK-10A for a trainer and the 1-23 and a newly-built 
Schweizer 1-26, both owned by Lin Bachtell. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Even in the early years, interest in cross-country and 
competition soaring was strong, with Lin Bachtell, Van Thaxton and various other 
members competing in the contests of the era. These involved endurance, altitude 
gain and cross-country distance. Significant interest was attracted to the club 
and numbers of pilots were first introduced to soaring by MGSA. Numerous airline 
pilots were introduced to the sport during two-hour turn-arounds at Macon 
Airport. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1960, Capt. Lin Bachtell was transferred to Dobbins Air 
Force Base in Marietta, Georgia, taking his 1-23 and 1-26. Since many members 
were from that and surrounding areas, the MGSA operation was moved and an 
association was formed with NOGASS, with whom informal ties already existed. Key 
NOGASS members in this time period were Ed Barnes, John Karlovich, and Joe 
Davis. In 1960, Ken Grubbs was elected President of MGSA. After a period of 
joint operations with NOGASS at Parkaire, the two clubs eventually merged in 
July 1962. MGSA was the surviving entity. Operations continued from Parkaire 
using the LK-10A and other private ships, including Lin Bachtell’s 1-23 and 1-26 
until he left the area due to a subsequent military transfer. Ken Grubbs 
continued as President and exerted strong leadership for the growing club for 
six more years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the 1961-62 time-period, explorations of soaring 
conditions at various remote sites were conducted. The first MGSA soaring 
operations at Andrews, NC, and FT. Payne, AL, were in this time period. In 
February 1962, Lin Bachtell climbed to 11,00 ft. in wave at Andrews. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1961, Ken Grubbs, Lee Cherry, Walt Harber, and Jim 
Briscoe, all of whom lived in Monroe, GA, requested and received permission from 
the City of Monroe to fill and grade the city dump to create a dirt strip for 
general aviation operations. This was the origin of the current Monroe Airport. 
After completion of the strip, Ken was made the first Airport Commissioner. At 
Ken’s urging, the club conducted periodic operations at Monroe, as well as other 
sites, as suburban development was beginning to encroach upon&nbsp; Parkaire. 
McCollum Airport in Cobb County was also a temporary operations site, but Monroe 
showed more promise for the long-term future of the club.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">During the mid-sixties, MGSA finally relocated to Monroe 
Airport, it’s current operating site. A hanger was available at Gunn Field in 
Dekalb County as that airport was closing for suburban redevelopment. Members 
acquired and moved the hanger to Monroe, where it was re-erected and became the 
club’s base. The club now uses this hanger (the Silver Hanger) for it’s 
operations. Duane Eisenbeiss, a United pilot based in Atlanta, and Jim 
Satterfield joined the club in this period and added strong enthusiasm to club 
operations. Both introduced many new pilots to soaring, Duane in his two-seat 
Pratt-Read, and Jim in the club LK-10A. The GLERC Soaring Club, sponsored by 
Lockheed-Georgia in Marietta, also recognized Monroe as a good site and 
relocated there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Following the move to Monroe, MGSA grew to the point it 
was able to afford its’ first towplane, a Stinson L-5. Later, the club’s first 
single-seat sailplane, a Schweizer 1-26, was purchased from T. I. Weston of 
Columbia, SC. In 1969, the LK-10A was sold to MGSA member Charlie Sparks. With 
the proceeds, a wooden Schleicher Ka-8B was purchased from the Memphis Soaring 
Club. Charlie Sparks subsequently converted the&nbsp; LK-10A back to its’ 
original World War II trainer “bunny-nose” configuration.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The late 1960s were a period of strong growth for soaring 
in the US, and MGSA was no exception. Bermuda High Soaring was started by Joe 
and Lucy Giltner in Chester, SC, in the late 1960s, and soaring received a shot 
in the arm with a commercial training site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Many area pilots were able to train there as well as at 
Antique Acres near Griffin, GA, started by Carl Hoffman, who received his 
soaring introduction and transition from the Giltners at Bermuda High. Numbers 
of current MGSA members received their training at these sites. National 
interest in soaring was stimulated by an article in the January 1967 issue of 
National Geographic. Following that, Walt Disney’s “The Boy Who Flew With the 
Condors” appeared on television and growth was stimulated well into the 1970s.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">By late 1969, MGSA operated the Schweizer 21-26 and Ka-8 
at Monroe and GLERC Soaring operated a Schweizer 2-33 and a Ka-8.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1970, MGSA dues were $48 per year and the initiation 
fee for new members was $100. No rental was charged for the gliders. Tows were 
$4.00 to 2000 feet. In 1969, the Family Membership was developed as a number of 
members had spouses and teenagers who wished to join and enjoy flying 
privileges. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">During the early 1970’s, stimulated by the new generation 
of all-fiberglass competition sailplanes, the Libelle and Standard Cirrus, and 
by several years experience in cross-country soaring, many MGSA members 
interests turned toward serious competition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1970, a group composed of Dave Culpepper, Woody 
Woodward, and John Karlovich decided to explore the possibilities for soaring 
competitions in South Georgia, an area&nbsp; noted for wide-open rural country 
and many World War II-era ex-military airfields. A survey tour of that area 
resulted in Crisp County Airport in Cordele, GA, being the top candidate. The 
airport, an old B-25 training base with three 5000 ft runways and only&nbsp; 
very limited local and transient traffic, as well as the crop-dusting operations 
typical of the area, was ideal, with a friendly airport manager, Dub Cooper. 
Forming an alliance with interested soaring groups in North Florida, MGSA 
launched into the world of Regional contest sponsorship. The first South Region 
V Soaring Contest was held in 1970. Since then, every summer has featured a 
Regional or National contest, all except two held at Cordele. Many MGSA members 
have served as contest workers and organizers over the years. Some have even 
retained their involvement with the contests after moving from the Atlanta area 
and leaving MGSA. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In this period, a group of serious racing pilots, Woody 
Woodward, Dave Culpepper, Bobby Bridges, Ed Sessions, Ed Barnes, and others, 
started an informal group, Atlanta Competition Club (A2C), for the purpose of 
improving their cross-country and competition skills. They met during the 
cross-country season on weekends at Monroe Airport. The weather was checked in 
the morning and a competition task was called when the weather was suitable. 
Many in this group became notable competitors on the national level, with Dave 
Culpepper winning the Standard Class Nationals in 1979 in his LS-3, flying with 
locked flaps. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With club interest growing in high-performance 
competition, MGSA sold the 1-26 in 1973 and purchased a Schempp-Hirth Phoebus B, 
one of the first production fiberglass high-performance sailplanes. Another 
two-place ship, a Schleicher Ka-7, was purchased from Chilhowee Gliderport in 
Benton, TN, in 1975. In 1976, the Phoebus was sold and a new fiberglass Grob 
Astir CS single-seater was purchased. Qualified MGSA members were allowed and 
encouraged to fly these ships cross country for badges and records and to enter 
competition, such as the Regionals at Cordele. MGSA’s by-laws encourage these 
member activities as that was and remains a primary purpose of the club. By its’ 
twentieth year, 1979, MGSA was well established, with clear ownership of three 
sailplanes and national recognition of many of its’ members due to both 
individual competition and cross-country achievements and sponsorship of 
Regional and National soaring championships.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the early 80s, MGSA began to upgrade its’ fleet. In 
1981, the Astir was sold as it proved unsuitable for club operations. Replacing 
it in December 1981 was an all-metal Pilatus B-4. In April 1982, an L-13 Blanik 
was located in California and purchased by the club for training and fun 
soaring. During this period, Dave Culpepper opened Monroe Flying Service and 
provided tows for the club with a Cessna 150. MGSA Full Membership dues were 
$200 per year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In late 1984, MGSA had the opportunity to purchase its’ 
first high-performance fiberglass two-seater, a new Grob G-103. The ship had 
been damaged in a trailering accident while being delivered to a new owner 
following shipment from Germany. The insurance company totaled the aircraft, and 
member Dave Stevenson purchased it and offered it to MGSA for $13,400. The 
repair, new canopies and fiberglass work, cost approximately $5100. By May 1985, 
the G-103 was in service. To finance the sale, the club sold the Ka-8 and the 
Pilatus B-4. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In Spring 1987, MGSA purchased a Schweizer 1-34 to replace 
the Pilatus as a medium performance single-seater. Following delivery, it was 
repainted a bright red by Charlie Meason. During Fall 1987 and Winter 1988, it 
was instrumented and tuned by Jerry Miller and Dave Stevenson. This activity led 
to the first win of a Nationals by an MGSA pilot in an MGSA ship. In Summer 
1988, Dave Stephenson took the 1-34 to the Sport Class Nationals at Hobb, NM, 
and won handily. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1988, MGSA sponsored and organized the SSA National 
Soaring Convention in Atlanta. Bob Grey and Bob Gaines were Chairman and 
Co-Chairman, respectively of the Convention organization. Bob Davis and Lynn 
Elliott coordinated the speakers and events. Rhetta Grey and Bill Brown handled 
registration. Jim Culp coordinated the exhibits and Mitch Deutsch, of Atlanta 
soaring Club, coordinated the volunteers. This was a major effort for MGSA and a 
very real success. The club received much recognition for this effort.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In the late 1980’s, developments in Monroe and increased 
general aviation activity led to pressures on the club that threatened to limit 
operations and hinder Monroe as a long-term site for the club. A number of 
members been to explore purchase of open land for development of a club-owned 
operating site. A site near Social Circle, near the small unincorporated 
community of Oasis was seriously explored. This site offered the possibility of 
a grass strip and sufficient land to sell subdivided lots to members as a means 
of financing. This possibility did not materialize as a local church objected to 
possible noise from aircraft weekend operations near their location. Another 
site, the Hogan Airstrip near Washington, GA, was assessed, but members felt it 
to be too far from Atlanta. With lagging development of the city of Monroe and a 
sluggish economy, general aviation activity at Monroe Airport slowed in the 
early 1990s. This and the relocation of the GLERC Soaring Club reduced the 
sailplane operating tempo at Monroe to the point that pressures on the club to 
relocate eased by the early 1990s. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1993, MGSA was faced with the need to acquire its’ own 
towplane. Ed Sessions had been providing tows to the club with his Cessna 180, 
but that aircraft was destroyed in a ground fire. A high-powered towplane was 
required due to the number of high-performance fiberglass ships owned by members 
and by the weight of the Grob G-103 with two passengers, with resulting adverse 
impact of initial climb performance in summer temperatures. A Pawnee in good 
condition was available from Art Mattews. The price, $30,000, was far in excess 
of club resources at the time. Contacts with other clubs, particularly 
Mid-Atlantic Soaring, had made the club aware of a financing method. The sale of 
capital units, NIRCUs and IRCUs( None Interest-bearing Capital Units and 
Interest-bearing Capital Units), was quickly developed and adopted by MGSA. This 
approach involved a requirement for each Member to purchase a NIRCU for $500. 
Members not desiring to do so could pay an additional $50 per year to pay 
interest on IRCUs, which could be bought by members who had already purchased 
their required NIRCU. Any number of IRCUs could be purchased by willing members. 
MGSA now had a capital-funding scheme in place to deal with aircraft purchase 
and other financial requirements. The Pawnee quickly proved to be a 
cash-generator for the club, and repayment of members IRCUs began as financial 
reserves were accumulated. Towing in the Pawnee was so attractive to towpilots 
that a numbers of members aquired a Cessna 140 in order to build the 
tail-dragger time required by the insurance companies. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In March 1994, a major event occurred that would greatly 
alter the scope and future of MGSA. The Atlanta Soaring Club had been based at 
Etowah Bend on an airstrip owned by MGSA member John Karlovich. This club was an 
outgrowth of the series of commercial operations and clubs which sprang from the 
original antique Acres and Peach State Gliderport. It had moved to John 
Karlovich’s strip in 1988 and enjoyed a period of growth and strong activity, 
many members acquiring fiberglass high-performance ships.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">However, personal and operational conflicts developed that 
led ASC to seek a new home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Not being able to successfully relocate their operation, 
ASC realized they needed to merge with a larger club in order to preserve their 
assets and to protect their members’ access to a soaring site. This led to a 
decision by MGSA to acquire the assets and equipment of ASC, based upon an offer 
by the ASC membership. Most ASC members moved to join MGSA. They brought two 
sailplanes to the combined club, a Grob G-102 single-seat fiberglass ship and an 
L-13 Blanik. Following the merger, MGSA’s fleet consisted of the G-103, the 
G-102, two L-13s, the 1-34 and the Pawnee towplane. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Many ASC members quickly became active and effective 
members of the MGSA organization. Mitch Deutsch assumed his long-time role of 
Treasurer, working behind the scenes to keep the finances well-organized. Other 
former-ASCers moved into leadership positions in the coming years, and several 
ASCers were President during the latter portion of the 1990s. Organizationally, 
the merger of the two clubs proved to be a great success and the growth and 
activity level of the club was greatly stimulated. The availability of the new 
Pawnee was a factor in this favorable situation, as a towplane&nbsp; purchase 
would have become necessary to support the increased level of activity. </font>
