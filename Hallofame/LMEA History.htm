<p>SOARING WITH LOCKHEED</p>

Treasurer, LMEA Soaring Club</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Did you know that one of the oldest 
continuously operating soaring clubs chartered in Georgia is not a public club, 
nor does it currently fly in Georgia (even though it is “based” in Marietta)? 
Have you ever wondered who owns that aluminum Blanik L-13 tied down outside the 
barn or the big old Open Cirrus inside the hangar at Chilhowee Gliderport in 
Tennessee? The answer to both questions is the Lockheed-Martin Employees 
Association (LMEA) Soaring Club. The LMEA Soaring Club, a chapter of the Soaring 
Society of America, is open to all Lockheed Martin employees, family members, 
retirees, on-plant military personnel, and vendor personnel on full time 
assignment to the Lockheed Martin facility in Marietta, Georgia. Two of its 
current members have been with the club more than 30 years! Among its former 
members are the late well-known Georgia pilot Edwin Barnes, Tennessee SSA state 
governor Bob Davis and former soaring partner of Shelly Charles, William Plage.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1966, as the C-141 program was winding 
down and the C-5A program was starting up, three engineers from the 
Lockheed-Georgia Company (GELAC, known as ”the bomber plant”) and another from 
Lockheed Air Services (LAS) got the soaring bug. The four, Roger Goodwin, Waco 
Wike, Steve Willliamson (GELAC) and Don Andrews (LAS), decided to establish the 
Lockheed Soaring Club. They tested the waters at Parkaire Airport (near the 
intersection of Johnson’s Ferry Road and Lower Roswell Road in Marietta) where 
the North Georgia Soaring (NOGAS) Club was operating. Their first ship was a 
tired but airworthy Schweizer TG-3A. The following spring they packed up and 
moved to the new airport in Monroe, joining the recently reorganized Mid-Georgia 
Soaring Association (MGSA). The club held their initial meeting at the plant 
that winter. The interest shown by the Lockheed employees was so favorable; they 
decided to petition Lockheed for sponsorship under the company’s employee 
recreation department, the Georgia Lockheed Employee’s Recreational Club (GLERC).</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">GLERC responded by buying a shiny new 1967 
Schweizer SGS 2-33 for the club to use. The club quickly grew to 30 members as 
employment at the Lockheed facility headed to a record 33,000. Several new club 
members made trips to Bermuda High Soaring in Chester, South Carolina to quickly 
add private and instructor ratings. The fledgling Lockheed soaring club 
recognized from the beginning the need to train ab initio members. They quickly 
established a permanent ongoing training program as an integral part of their 
operating philosophy. As employment at the plant grew with the C-5A program, so 
did the club. In 1969, the club and the GLERC organization together (the club 
itself putting up 1/3 of the funds) bought a new Schleicher Ka-8b to keep up 
with the growth of the membership.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Then disaster struck. The C-5A program was 
prematurely canceled in the early 1970s and 20,000 people lost their jobs. 
Because the club was affiliated with Lockheed and membership was restricted to 
employees and family members, membership dropped off drastically to 9. GLERC 
Soaring was unable to pay the bills. In order to survive, the club agreed to 
give their equity and total ownership of the Ka-8 to GLERC in exchange for 
Lockheed paying their outstanding debts. GLERC wanted to sell the Ka-8, but the 
soaring club members convinced the GLERC council to keep it. GLERC owned the 
sailplanes so they called the shots on membership, severely hamstringing the 
club’s ability to grow by bringing in new members from outside of Lockheed. As a 
minor event, this author joined as the 10th member in 1976, immediately becoming 
an officer and the third instructor on the staff.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">As Lockheed recovered, the club bounced 
back reaching 22 members in the early 1980's. The club became a chapter of the 
Soaring Society of America in 1976. In 1984 the 2-33 was traded for a L-13 
Blanik from Switzerland. The club built a trailer for the Ka-8 and began taking 
trips to the wave camp in North Carolina and the Sequatchie ridge in Tennessee. 
Members added gold and diamond badges using&nbsp; club and member-owned 
equipment. On one particular outing to the Marion wave camp, six members 
achieved gold altitudes and one diamond in one day, the last landing being made 
after dark!</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1987, the Ka-8 was damaged in a landing 
accident at Monroe and was sold to a party in England. It was temporarily 
replaced with a leased Schweizer 1-26 until six months later when a 1967 
Schempp-Hirth Open Cirrus, N99VJ, became the new GLERC-owned single-seater. Once 
again the single-seater was paid for with a combination of Lockheed and club 
funds. A year later that ship was also severely damaged, however this time 
insurance funds allowed the purchase of a replacement (their current) Open 
Cirrus, N757N.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Throughout the history of the Lockheed 
Soaring Club, they have never owned a towplane and thus have always been reliant 
on other organizations for tows. The availability of commercial tows and the 
attractiveness of the 18-mile long ridge with year-round flying opportunities 
influenced the club to move to Chilhowee Gliderport int he late 1980's It 
flourished there for more than a decade until the untimely death of 
owner-operator Mike Reisman. With the closing of Chilhowee, the Lockheed Soaring 
Club needed a new home. They accepted the gracious invitation of the Southern 
Eagles Soaring club to join them at SES's new home at LaGrange-Calloway 
Municipal Airport in LaGrange, Georgia, Lockheed's 4th home in 30 years. 
Lockheed and its members were fully affiliated with SES for several years.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The year 2000 saw the Lockheed Soaring 
Club moved back to the newly-reopened Chilhowee Gliderport where it continues to 
operate today. Due to downsizing at the Lockheed plant, now with less than 7000 
employees, the membership has once again decreased to only 11 members. But there 
is hope on the horizon. Lockheed Martin is now considering allowing a portion of 
the Soaring Club membership to come from the public arena.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Over three and a half decades hundreds of 
people have passed through the membership ranks of the Lockheed Soaring Club. 
Many members have achieved diamond badges and competed in national competitions. 
Some former students have moved on to become professional airline pilots. The 
club saw its name change to the Lockheed Martin Employees Association (LMEA) 
Soaring Club with the merger of the Lockheed and Martin corporations, but the 
spirit remains the same. Perhaps the adventures will continue.</font></p>
